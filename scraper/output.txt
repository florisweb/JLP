She'll be so happy.","type":2,"level":5},{"character":"お姉さん","readings":["おねえさん"],"meanings":["Older Sister","Miss"],"meaningInfo":"The <span lang=\"ja\">お</span> makes the word more polite. You're elevating the \"<span class=\"vocabulary-highlight\" title=\"Vocabulary\" rel=\"tooltip\">older sister</span>\" title because you're a good younger sibling. Otherwise, the meaning of this word is the same as the kanji - just the feeling is different. You can also use this word to refer to a youthful-looking woman that you don't know, as in \"Excuse me <span class=\"vocabulary-highlight\" title=\"Vocabulary\" rel=\"tooltip\">miss</span>!\" ","readingInfo":"The reading is different too. It has some hiragana attached to it, which is a clue that this uses a kun'yomi reading. Let's use a mnemonic to learn that reading. </p><p>Imagine your <span class=\"vocabulary-highlight\" title=\"Vocabulary\" rel=\"tooltip\">older sister</span> (even if you don't have one). She is, for some reason, a horse. Imagine petting her, giving her carrots, and doing other horse-related things with her. What do horses say?
